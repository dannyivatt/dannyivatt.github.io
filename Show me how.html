							<h3>Advantages</h3>
							<p>By rewarding the user community you ensure that their knowledge is shared. They are incentivized to help each other and work towards your goals, whether supporting your product, or stimulating development on your platform.</p>

<p>By rewarding your users, an engaged and active community develops and expert help and support can be provided at a low cost to you but with a very high value to your users.  </p> 
						</section>
						<section>
							
							<h3>Security</h3>
							<p>Through vote fuzzing and normalisation, IP restriction and active moderation, our security measures mean that bots, spam, fraud, multiple accounts and astroturfing are disallowed. Our measures ensure that community contributions are on topic and relate to the goals set for your community.</p> <p>Optionally create a closed, invite only community tied to licensing for your product.</p>
						</section>
					</div>
					<div class="features-row">
						<section>
							
							<h3>Customisation and Rewards</h3>
							<p>Provide rewards that match the goals of your community and the product being suported. Integrate with Alit.io to offer reduced licensing costs, or free product usage for star users. Offer app store downloads or free development tools to incentivize your developer community.</p> 
						</section>
						<section>
							
							<h3>Costs</h3>
							<p>By offering rewards related to your product, you give users incentives of real value, but at a reduced expense to you. You set the limits and conversion rate for userâ€™s points totals and only reward the contributions you and your community find valuable.</p> <p>Alit.io is a radically cheaper alternative to traditional support channels or paying for development.</p>
