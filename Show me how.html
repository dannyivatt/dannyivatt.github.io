							<h3>Advantages</h3>
							<p>By rewarding the user community you ensure that their knowledge is shared. They are incentivized to help each other and work towards your goals.</p>

<p>An engaged and active community develops and expert help and support can be provided at a low cost to you but with rewards of a very high value to them.  </p> 
						</section>
						<section>
							
							<h3>Security</h3>
							<p>Alit.io is a closed community tied to licensing for your product. Community rules encourage active participation and users can downvote spam and posts that do not contribute to the goals you set. Active moderation ensures that you have complete control over the forum, redemption of points and the store.</p><p> Other security measures such as vote fuzzing and normalisation and IP restriction mean that bots, spam and astroturfing are disallowed. These measures ensure that community contributions are on topic and relate to the goals set by you.</p> <p></p>
						</section>
					</div>
					<div class="features-row">
						<section>
							
							<h3>Customization and Rewards</h3>
							<p>Provide rewards that match the goals of your community and the product being suported. </p><p>Integrate with Alit.io to offer reduced licensing costs, or free product usage for star users. Offer purchases from your marketplace, or offers from partner organisations.</p> 
						</section>
						<section>
							
							<h3>Costs</h3>
							<p>By offering rewards related to your product, you give users incentives of real value, but at a reduced expense to you. You set the limits and conversion rate for userâ€™s points totals and only reward the contributions you and your community find valuable.</p>
