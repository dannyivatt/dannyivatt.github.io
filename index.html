							<h3>For SaaS organisations</h3>
							<p>Alit.io is a radically cheaper alternative to traditional support channels. Incentivize your user community to support each other by offering tangible incentives and rewards that you control. By creating an Alit.io community, you can supplement or replace expensive customer support channels with the expert knowledge that exists amongst your users.</p>

							<span class="icon major fa-line-chart accent3"></span>
							<h3>For growing products</h3>
							<p>Providing support to users when you are challenged with growing a new product or platform is difficult and expensive. We provide a platform that allows you to reward your users for supporting each other, with incentives that you own and control. </p>

							<span class="icon major fa-desktop accent4"></span>
							<h3>For technical communities</h3>
							<p>Alit.io is ideally suited to reward technical communities for supporting each other. Experienced users are rewarded, while less experienced users learn, ask questions, and grow while working to customise your product or to produce applications for your ecosystem.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon major fa-user-plus accent5"></span>
							<h3>For users</h3>
							<p>Inexperienced users ask questions, tap into an expert, community created knowledge base and vote for the submissions that contribute most to their learning. They can grow, share and get effective support.

<p>Experienced users respond to questions, provide how-tos and documentation, contribute to the knowledge base and give expert advice. Users vote on each other's submissions. They can redeem those votes for items of real value that you provide. </p>
