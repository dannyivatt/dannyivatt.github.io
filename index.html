							<h3>For developer communities</h3>
							<p>Alit.io is ideally suited to reward technical communities for supporting each other. Experienced developers are rewarded, while less experienced developers learn, ask questions, and grow while working to produce applications for your platform.</p>

							<span class="icon major fa-user-plus accent5"></span>
							<h3>For users</h3>
							<p>Inexperienced users ask questions, tap into an expert, community created knowledge base and vote for the submissions that contribute most to their learning. They can grow, share and get effective support.

<p>Experienced users respond to questions, provide how-tos and documentation, contribute to the knowledge base and give expert advice. Users vote on each other's submissions. They can redeem those votes for items of real value that you provide. </p>
